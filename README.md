## Course Structure

In this course, following agile methodology, students work as a team of engineers to implement a software tool specified by the company partner. This semester, our industry partners are Acutec and NetApp. At the intervals outlined by the company partner, students meet with the industry mentors and supervisors for regular meetings, to outline what has been completed, what challenges were encountered, and to plan what you need to work on next. Industry mentors will also be available to answer students' questions asynchronously. 

## Expectations

- Dedication of 8-9 hours of work to the project
- Regular attendance
- Regular communication with the industry mentor
- Follow good project management techniques
- Use GitHub Flow and GitHub Issue Tracker
- Completion of assigned tasks
- Engagement and participation with the team

## Deliverables

- Midterm presentation
- Final presentation
- Continuous engagement as evident by GitHub commits
- Completed software tool

## Policies

### Grading

The grade for this course will be based on the feedback from the industry partners, the two presentations, your documented engagement via GitHub, and the status of the completed software tool.

### Allegheny College statement of community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor's assistance should schedule an appointment through her [Office Hour Calendar](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/schedule).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which interfere with your ability to participate in or complete course assignments, let me know immediately. Do not wait until the last day of class to ask for exceptions to what is stated in this syllabus.
